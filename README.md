# Yaniv-Card-Game
This unusual draw and discard game is played in Nepal, where it is known as Dhumbal or Jhyap. Around the beginning of the 21st century it became popular under the name Yaniv with young players in Israel, both at home and when travelling abroad. It has since spread to other countries, for example a version in played in the Netherlands where it is known as Kluft. It is somewhat akin to Rummy, in that players can get rid of cards by forming them into sets and sequences, but the mechanism of play is different. Sets and runs are not melded but discarded, so that one of the cards used can be picked up by the next player.

The objective of the game is to have a lower total value of cards in your hand than the other players. When you think you have achieved this, you call "Jhyap" in Nepal or "Yaniv" in Israel to stop the play and compare hands. "Jhyap" is a slang word meaning intoxicated or "high", and "Yaniv" is a Hebrew personal name. If someone else has an equal or lower total, the caller gets a penalty. In Israel, this situation is known by some players as "Asaf", which is another Hebrew name.

Each game is composed of rounds, and each player's total score is updated after each round. The goal of the game is to keep your score to a minimum. Players with more than an agreed maximum, for example 200 points, drop out of the game, which is then continued until there is only one player left.

## Players and Cards
This game can be played by 2 or more players. It is said to be best for 2-5 but in theory up to 8 or more people could play, though with a large number of players the game would be very slow.
A 54 card deck is used - the standard international deck with two jokers. When there are four or more players, some people prefer to use two such decks shuffled together, to avoid running out of cards. In that case you continue to use the double deck even after the number of players is reduced below 4.
Each card in the deck has a value: each ace is worth 1; cards 2-10 are worth their face value; pictures (J, Q, K) are worth 10 and jokers are worth zero.

## Play
The starting player for the first round should be chosen in advance by some random method, since the starting player has an advantage. In subsequent rounds the winner of the previous round starts. The turn to play passes clockwise around the table.

In your turn you are allowed to do one of two things:
1. Throw one or more cards from hand to the Dump Pile and then pick one card up;
2. Call "Yaniv" (in Israel) or "Jhyap" (in Nepal) to end the play, if you believe that the total value of your cards is less than that of any other player. You may call "Jhyap" or "Yaniv" only if the total value of your cards is less than 6.

## Scoring
The object is to score as few points as possible, and in particular to keep your cumulative total below 200.

When someone uses their turn to call for end the play, all players immediately reveal their cards.

If a player's score is exactly 200, it is reduced to 100. In the same way, if a player's score is exactly 100 it is reduced to 50. It is possible to aim for these numbers by calling when you expect to lose - for example with a score of 166 you might well call with 4 points in your hand hoping to lose and score 34.
